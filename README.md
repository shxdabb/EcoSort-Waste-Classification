🌟 Waste Classification using CNN + Streamlit

A Deep Learning–based waste classification system that identifies images of waste into 10 categories using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and provides an interactive Streamlit web interface.

This project supports sustainable waste management by automating waste segregation and making recycling more efficient.

 Project Goals

Build a CNN to classify types of waste

Improve accuracy using data augmentation and deeper models

Deploy the trained model using Streamlit

Provide an easy-to-use UI for real-time testing

Support sustainability through AI-based waste segregation


🗂️ Waste Categories

The system classifies waste into 10 classes:

battery

biological

cardboard

clothes

glass

metal

paper

plastic

shoes

trash

🗓️ Week-Wise Progress
🗓️ Week 1 — Data Exploration & Preprocessing
✅ Tasks Completed

Loaded the local dataset garbage-dataset

Verified folder structure and class names

Counted number of images in each class

Displayed sample images

Resized all images to 64×64 for memory efficiency

Normalized pixel values

Created a train-validation split

Documented all work in week1_data_exploration.ipynb

🗓️ Week 2 — Base CNN Model Building & Training
✅ Tasks Completed

Built a simple CNN using TensorFlow/Keras

Trained model on all 10 waste classes

Achieved ~58% validation accuracy

Plotted accuracy & loss graphs

Saved the trained model

Updated notebook: week2_cnn_training.ipynb

🔧 Improvements (Week 2)

Added dropout layer to reduce overfitting

Cleaned and optimized data pipeline

Improved visualization (accuracy/loss curves)

Enhanced model structure and comments

🗓️ Week 3 — Model Improvement + Deployment
🎯 Improvements Applied

Added data augmentation

Built a deeper CNN with BatchNormalization

Trained longer with callbacks

Saved best model as waste_classifier_model.h5

Created a full Streamlit web app

Designed a clean, professional UI

All improvements documented in week3_model_improvement.ipynb
